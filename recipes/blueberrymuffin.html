        This blueberry muffin recipe makes eight extra large and yummy breakfast muffins with a 
        recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top for a wonderful,
        sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add extra blueberries if you want! This blueberry
        muffin recipe is moist, sweet, and bursting with fruity flavor. A buttery streusel topping takes this indulgent breakfast over the top.
