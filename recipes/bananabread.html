            Description
        </h2>
        
        This banana bread is super moist thanks to butter, eggs, and brown sugar (which adds more moisture than white sugar). Plus, mashed bananas have plenty of moisture on their own. 
        Make sure you store the banana bread properly to keep it moist for several days. This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads of banana flavor. Why compromise the banana flavor? Friends and family love my recipe and say it's by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted. Enjoy!
